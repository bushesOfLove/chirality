        <p class="header" style="font-weight: bold; border-style:double ;">The Thalidomide Tragedy</p>

        <p class="normal">
            In the 1950s, Thalidomide was introduced as a morning sickness drug for pregnant women.
            <br>
            However, severe birth defects are reported.
        </p>

        <p class="normal">
            In the "identical" molecules above, simply because there's a 
            <strong>chiral center</strong> present, one of which became a poison that causes severe birth defects,
            <br>
            while the other is effective in alleviating morning sickness.
        </p>

        <p class="normal" style="padding-bottom: 5%;">
            The overlook of enantiomers has caused over <strong>24,000</strong> babies with congenital disabilities.
            <br>
            Therefore, I choose to look into the world of enantiomers and how they could possibly affect our lives.
        </p>

        <p class="normal" style="padding-bottom: 5%;">
            Thankfully, after checking with our guest speaker, I realized that our bodies are perfectly capable of producing
            molecules that have correct configuration of chirality. 
            <br>One less thing to worry about!

        <p class="normal" style="padding-bottom: 5%;">
            <strong>Enantiomers</strong> are mirror images of molecules. <br>They are like your left and right hand. They look alike,
            but they are essentially not the same, because they cannot be superimposed.
            <br>However, your hands may be able to perform the same function, but a little change in the stereochemistry
            can have a substantial impact.

            2. Chirality
        </p>
        
        <p class="normal">
            <strong>Chirality</strong> determines whether the molecule has <strong>enantiomers</strong>
            like the molecule Thalidomide.
            <br>
            Whether a molecule is chiral or not depends on its <strong>chirality center</strong>.
            <br>
            <strong>Chirality center</strong> is an atom that is connected to four different functional groups.
            <br>

        </div>
        <p class="normal">
            If the molecule doesn't have chirality center (a.k.a. Achiral), then we're safe. There will be no scary enantiomers of it that
            could cause tragic effects.

            1. <strong>Unnatural Amino Acids</strong> by Loredano Pollegioni and Stefano Servi
        </p>
        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            This book talks about the non-proteinogenic amino acids, which are amino acids of the opposite chirality
            compared to the ones in our proteins. This is extremely relevant to my
            topic because amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and that are specifically related to food.
            We have many types of amino acids in our bodies, yet only one of them is achiral. Therefore it would be
            interesting to discover the synthesis of amino acids of the opposite chirality and how it would affect its chemical property.
            Perhaps we couldn't digest it anymore?

        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            Expanding on the last reference, this also talks about the synthesis of amino caids enantioselectively. This book covers
            natural products that contain Beta-Amino Acids. But then again, I would expect to use this reference the same way I use the previous one.

        </p>
        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            Glucose, which forms starch, is an essential part of our everyday diet. There's
            corn, bread, potato, wheat, etc.
            The glucose that we digest is in D configuration. In this regard, what if it becomes
            L-enantiomeric? This article covers how they would analyze how algae utilizes β-glucans.
            If humans can't digest it, how about algae?

            4. <strong>High-Throughput Capillary Electrophoresis–Mass Spectrometry: From Analysis of Amino Acids to Analysis of Protein Complexes</strong> by Mehdi Moini
        </p>
        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            This book analyzes the amino acids in the aspect of stereochemistry --- their enantiomers. In addition,
            this book also analyzes the amino acids in a macroscopic level --- proteins.
            This would be relevant to my research since I don't have access to advanced lab equipments and the 
            conducted research would facilitate my understanding in amino acids of different configurations.

        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            This book analyzes the the strucutre an function of proteases, which are the enzymes responsible for digesting
            amino acids. Looking into the strucutre and function of proteases can help me to understand why we can only digest
            amino acids of mostly L-configuration.

        </p>
        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            Since not only do I plan to investigate the enantiomers of amino acids, but also glucose, it is only reasonable to look
            into the enzyme that digests starch. This book provides a comprehensive overview of starch digestion, which, simmilar to
            proteases, would help me to understand the orientation of human pancreatic α-amylase and maltase-glucoamylase.

        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            Thalidomide has a huge effect on the human body, it is only reasonable to wonder if enantiomers of amino acids would taste different. Besides, this book
            also covers many aspects of amino acids.

        <p class="normal" style="text-align: left; padding: 2%;">
            I do not have a robust understanding in organic chemistry yet. Therefore I would like to learn more about them in the book, which
            for sure covers stereochemistry, and will enhance my understanding. To make tenable hypothesis, I would need more information in organic chemistry. Consequently,
            a introductory textbook in organic chemistry would help.
